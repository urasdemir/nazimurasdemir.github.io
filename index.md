# Welcome!

About me:

I am a computational political scientist. I specialize in quantitative research methodology and international relations. My research explores economic statecraft.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the KU Trade War Lab. I was formerly a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Predoctoral Research Fellow at, a Smith Richardson Foundation World Politics and Statecraft Fellow, and a UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation Dissertation Fellow.
​
I taught courses on research methodology and international relations at the University of California, Irvine, and Chapman University. I was a Pedagogical Fellow and a Teaching Apprentice at UC Irvine's Division of Teaching Excellence and Innovation.
 
I enjoy exploring data and have worked as a quantitative researcher for numerous projects. I use R for my work, and I have experience teaching it. I also have experience with Python, SQL, and Tableau. Feel free to check out some of my project demos.
 
I received my Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine's Department of Political Science. I received my MSc from École des Hautes Études Commerciales du Nord (EDHEC) in Lille, France, in Global Business with a concentration on Finance. My thesis research on financial herding behavior detection in equity markets received the institution's best research award. I received my joint BSc in International Relations from the State University of New York at Binghamton and Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. My native language is Turkish, and I am conversational in French and Japanese.
