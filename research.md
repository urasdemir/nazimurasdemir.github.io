## Ongoing and Recent Projects

### Global Supply Chains in Economic Statecraft

This study explores why trade interdependence fosters cooperation for some states but exacerbates conflict for others. I argue that the composition of intermediate good flows plays a crucial role in these outcomes. Using clustering algorithms, I categorize intermediate goods and develop an index quantifying interstate conflict and cooperation. Through multilevel modeling and case studies on East Asia, I demonstrate the causal mechanism. An abridged version of the quantitative analysis is currently under review.

*The paper is under review.

### Are Global Supply Chains Vital for China’s Leaders?

This study examines China’s outward-looking political economy and the role of global supply chains. We identify growing challenges to China’s supply chain activities and three key leadership perspectives on GSCs. The balance between these views will shape the future of global interdependence.

### Do Allies' Supply Chains Also Follow the Flag?

This project reexamines the "trade follows the flag" hypothesis in intermediate goods trade. Using the US-China trade war as a quasi-experimental intervention, we estimate counterfactual trends in intermediate goods outflows from U.S. military allies to both countries. Our findings show that military alliances can influence trade flows during crises.

### Rally around the Flag? Consumer Responses to Economic Sanctions

This paper examines how citizens respond when foreign adversaries impose economic sanctions on domestic goods. Using a quasi-experimental approach, it analyzes China's 2021–2023 sanctions on Taiwanese fruit and seafood, measuring buycott effects across impacted products. The study tests conditions under which consumers increase domestic purchases to counter sanctions. It contributes to research on political consumerism, economic sanctions, and the link between conflict and commerce.

*The paper is under review.

### Learning International Relations Theory by Doing: Two Novel Games

This study uses teaching-as-research to examine the impact of competitive and collaborative games in international relations education. I introduce novel classroom games that reflect realist and liberal theories. Using a post-pre survey design, we assess their effects on student course preferences, learning efficacy, and retention.
